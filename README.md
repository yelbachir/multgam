# multgam
Rcpp package implementing automatic smoothing for multiple generalized additive models as described in El-Bachir and Davison (2019).

## 1. Installation
`multgam` must be installed from source as follows: 
1. Download the repository `multgam`.
2. Run `install.R`.


## 2. Examples


Several examples can be found in the subdirectory `/simulation_paper/Multgam`, which reproduces Section 3 of the paper.

## 3. Addition of new families of distributions
